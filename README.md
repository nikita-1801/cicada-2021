# Problem Statement
As the world shuts down in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the difficulties faced by pregnant women have increased manifolds. The main challenges are posed during the first trimester and the third trimester when the patient must undergo diagnostic tests, scans and investigations every week or so in order to confirm the pregnancy and check for abnormalities, bleeding, chances of abortions or miscarriages. During these times, expecting mothers constantly fear contraction of COVID-19 through hospital visits, hence the need for a platform that allows them to indicate a possible pregnancy, continuously monitor their symptoms and send warnings in case of any abnormalities, and to review their diet and exercise plans.
# Idea and Solution
Through our web page, we strive to make extremely vital things, such as pregnancy tests and medical assistance, easily accessible for those who don’t have it. Users are able to select a region that they are located in or near and then will be directed to a safe and legitimate health center to receive all the help and support they may need for their upcoming pregnancy. 
This app will have quizzes for mothers to take every trimester so that they can be safe and ensure their baby’s safety as well. These quizzes will check the general well being of the mother and the child and also cover the do’s and dont’s to take care of during this time. It will also alert the mother in case there is any issue and immediate medical assistance is required. Our application will also have a Blog for mothers to read articles, get exercise and food tips among many others. It will prevent them from loneliness and they will get less stressed knowing that someone is there with them.
We aim to do so by making a portal where guardians of kids who lost their mothers can post and the active users of page who were recently pregnant can connect with them and help them. It was implemented with the help  of nodejs , express and ejs backend with database of mongodb atlas by asking such families to put request and their request will be posted on our App and the capable donor can help them with same.This makes easy for them to connect especially during times of Pandemic.
